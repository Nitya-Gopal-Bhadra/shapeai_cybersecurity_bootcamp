PYTHON AND  CYBER SECURITY BOOT CAMP BY SHAPE AI


Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by SHAPEAI . The instructor during the session was Mr. Harsh Akshit (Student Lead At Google). I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.
it was a great experience attending the bootcamp.I made this weather forecasting program using python and 3rd party api.
